### 7.How do you handle continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines?

* One must use AWS Developer tools to help get started with storing and versioning an applicationâ€™s source code. 
* This is followed by using the services to automatically build, test, and deploy the application to a local environment or to AWS instances.

* It is advantageous, to start with the CodePipeline to build the continuous integration and deployment services and later on use CodeBuild and CodeDeploy as per need.
