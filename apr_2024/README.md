* What is DevOps?

* What is computer?
    * Processor
    * RAM
    * Storage
    * OS = Graphics + Kernel
    * Why servers will not have graphics
* Laptop/Desktop = Internet surfing + Development + Songs + Movies = daily use
* Mobile = Apps + Internet + calling
* Server = to server the application

* more graphics = more memory + more power + more time
* Server = less memory + less power + less AC + less time + less cost

Client and Server
-----------------
* in or internet world, everything is a computer
* we have a Lawyer, we are clients for him
* legal server, so we clients
* who gives info = service provider
* who request info = client

* laptop = client
* mobile = server
 
* mobile = client
* laptop = server

What is DevOps?
---------------
* stakeholders --> who are part of system
* school = students, parents, teacher
 
* ideally 100% students should get pass
* only one final exam 50 years back
* student = he will not study from DAY-1
* teachers = teachers may not focus to complete syllabus from DAY-1
* parents = they always worried about their children from DAY-1

* clients == parents

* pass percentage was very less

30 years back
-------------

* unit test - I, unit test - II, unit test- III, Half yearly, unit test - IV, grand test and final test.

* student = student may start study JUL 1st week
* parents = they will wait until JUL 3rd week

* everybody will analyse results.

* 100 --> 30 members got 31%

* Unit test - II --> 72%
* Unit test - III --> 80%
* Final exam - 90%


15 years back
-------------
* daily slip tests

* Day1 we teach something
* Day2 we will conduct exam, max 5 questions
* students = they start studying from Day1
* teachers = they start teaching from day1
* parents = they can see results from day1

* Now pass percentage is 95.5%

* process improvement is the `key` for best results


* whatsapp --> 2011 different
* whatsapp --> 2024 different from 2011

* process improvement happened in whatsapp system...


SDLC --> Software Development LifeCycle
------

* Requirements gathering --> what our customer want
* Analysis --> Analyse the requirements
* Design --> Start designing the project, customer will accept the designing
* Develop/Implementation --> Implement the designing
* Deployment 
* Test --> Test the design and everything
* Maintainance --> 


* Waterfall --> water is falling to down
* Construction is over --> but testing is failed, output is not as per the design Demolish the house, start again

* 50% construction is over --> now customer wants some change in design 

Disadvantages
---------------
* It can't accomodate new requirements
* Final product output is only at the end

IT --> Waterfall
----------------
* students = developers
* parents = clients
* teachers = testing team


* developers, testers, clients

* 2 or 3 years of time
* developers = no development from day1
* testers = no testing from day1
* clients = worried 

* after 1 year they start serious development
* few employees will resign, new employees will come = KT
* started the development
* testing what to do? reading 100's of pages from client requirement and planning test cases...
* development is completed in DEV env, developers tested it is good
* testing environment --> under presure. raise more and more defects
* started fights between developers and testers
* 100 defects --> 80 defects valid, 20 defects invalid
* lot of emails between developers and testers... involving team leaders.. involving managers... account head


* clients == Ferrari == Maruthi 800


Agile 
------

* Start with small things  --> keep short goals 
* divide the system into small modules
* Signup and Login 
* Catalogue
* Cart
* Payment
* Delivery

* Sprints and modules

Sprint1 may be for 1 month
--------------------------
* signup and login
* Developers = they start from day1 = 1.5 week for development
* testers = 1.5 week for testing
* 1 week for development

* 1.5 weeks = developers conc is more
* testers = focus is less

* 10 defects --> 8 valid, 2 invalid

* again same fight
* 90% completed, 10% pending

Sprint2 product catalogue
-------------------------
* 10% backlog

Sprint - final
-------------

* exspect Ferrari == Output is Honda City


* 2016 --> too much load on servers
* Daily slip test = daily testing

Sprint1 = process improvement
----------------------------
* day1 he developed a code for
* Enter your First Name
* Day1 ask testing team to test his small code
* Positive and negative test cases
    * enter the name in 20 characters
    * enter the numbers in the field
* 10 test cases -->
* day2 ==> no chance of raising invalid defects. 3 valid defects.
* Develpers and testers will communicate


* If the code developed is built and tested on the same day then you can call it as DevOps
DevOps ==> We can     
    * Faster releases to the market
    * Less defects
* Amazon vs Flipkart
    * Every 11.2sec they do one release, fully automated with less defects

* Manual testing --> Automated testing
    * Build and deployment --> 

Deployment
-------------
* 1.0 --> running

* Download the new version
* Stop the system
* Remove old version
* Install new version
* Start the system   


DevOps and Cloud two wheels for a bike
--------------------------------------

Server
------
Windows vs Linux --> Linux (speed and effient)
Super computers also use Linux

everything is command here --> everything is text

Linux can run for years without restart
less power
less bandwidth
less memory
100% free
fast


We will start learning Linux

Aws account create --> free trail
500-1000rs per month
if more bill --> ask AWS they will refund
1Lakh --> please refund
